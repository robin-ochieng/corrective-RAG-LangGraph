# Retrieval Verification Report

## Objective
Confirm that the corrective RAG implementation retrieves supporting context from the persisted vector databases (Chroma and FAISS) before generating answers.

## Implementation Summary
- **Ingestion Pipeline (`src/corrective_rag/ingestion/pipeline.py`):**
  - Splits incoming documents and persists embeddings to both Chroma (`vectorstores/chroma`) and FAISS (`vectorstores/faiss`).
  - Accepts a pluggable `Embeddings` implementation, enabling offline tests and demos.
- **Vector Retriever (`src/corrective_rag/retrievers/vector.py`):**
  - Loads the stored Chroma and FAISS indexes and performs similarity search across both.
  - Deduplicates results and exposes matched `Document` objects with source metadata.
- **Graph Integration (`src/corrective_rag/nodes/retrieve.py` + `src/corrective_rag/graph.py`):**
  - The `RetrieveNode` invokes `VectorRetriever.retrieve` and attaches the returned documents to the shared `GraphState` before the LLM-based `DocumentGraderNode`, conditional `WebSearchNode`, and LLM-powered `GenerationNode` run.
  - `CorrectiveRAG.query` now always builds the LangGraph with LLM nodes, so retrieval feeds directly into an LLM that synthesizes the final answer (instead of the previous heuristic fallback).

## Automated Evidence
- `tests/test_corrective_rag.py::test_corrective_rag_retrieval` ingests sample text into temporary Chroma/FAISS stores, runs `CorrectiveRAG.query`, and asserts that retrieved documents surface in the final state while the LLM generation metadata reflects their use.
- `tests/test_graph_execution` compiles the full LangGraph (with deterministic overrides) and verifies that downstream nodes receive and process retrieved context.
- All 17 unit tests pass (`poetry run pytest`), confirming the retrieval workflow works in both isolated and end-to-end scenarios.

## Manual Verification (scripts/verify_retrieval.py)
A purpose-built script demonstrates retrieval using deterministic demo embeddings:

```bash
poetry run python scripts/verify_retrieval.py
```

Sample output (when run without external API keys, using demo embeddings):
```
Question: What does retrieval augmented generation do?
Answer: Top match from inline::1:
Retrieval augmented generation grounds responses using a knowledge base....

Retrieved documents:
- Retrieval augmented generation grounds responses using a knowledge base. | source: inline::1

Metadata:
{'retrieval': {'query': 'What does retrieval augmented generation do?', 'sources': ['inline::0', 'inline::1'], 'chunk_count': 2, 'graded': True, 'kept_documents': 1, 'dropped_documents': 1}, 'web_search_required': False, 'web_search': {'performed': True, 'query': None, 'results': 0, 'documents_added': 0}, 'generation': {'used_documents': 1, 'context_chars': 72, 'strategy': 'simple_fallback'}}
```

Key takeaways:
- Documents persisted to the temporary Chroma/FAISS stores are retrieved and attached to the graph state.
- Retrieval metadata records the query, sources, and chunk counts, demonstrating active vector-store usage.
- When OpenAI/Tavily keys are provided, the live system swaps in the LLM grader/generator and produces conversational answers while still grounding in retrieved context. The verification script intentionally avoids those APIs so it can run offline, but the retrieval signals behave identically.

## Conclusion
Both automated tests and manual execution confirm that the corrective RAG pipeline reads from the vector databases before producing answers. Contributors can rerun either the targeted pytest cases or `scripts/verify_retrieval.py` to validate retrieval after future changes.
